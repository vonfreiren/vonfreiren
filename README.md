## Profile

What I like most about my job is combining the three main aspects I am passionate about:

- Product Development and Project Management
- Software Development & Applications
- Finance and Investment Management

Even I consider myself a creative person, I also like taking ideas from different situations, in order to look for any aspect that will improve our products. In order to do so, I also think listening both clients and colleagues in order to get the best from the mix is one of my best attributes.
